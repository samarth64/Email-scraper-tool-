# Email-scraper-tool-
I have created a scrapper tool in which we need to provide csv file full of url and the we just need to give the location of that file then it will scrap all the emails present in the file and store it in a new csv file 
if you want to run it in your device you need to import the following modules
- requests 
- csv
thats all you will need to run the program
